    COMPONENTS INSIDE


    reducers --> components -->include provider in the index.js

==================== ====================
- made a reducer data to add to store
- combine reducers and add to store
- Provider allows every component to have access to the data in the store
- map state to props
-action function; link it to the container 
***Actions automatically gets sent to ALL REDUCERS***
-reducer is smart part and decides how it changes data
